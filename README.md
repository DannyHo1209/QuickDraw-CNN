# QuickDraw-Sketches-CNN
This is a project that uses CNN to determine what are the quick draw represent.
We used the dataset 'QuickDraw Sketches' for training and testing our model.

Here is the link for the dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/google/tinyquickdraw?select=baseball+bat.ndjson

Members : 1092b0014 / 1092b0003

Motivation :
You won't accept it if I say 'There is no exact motivates for doing this, but I would say it's because it looks fun :)'.
So, here is why : Since this is a dataset from the Google game 'Quick, Draw!', it's essential for most draw games. Imagine if this could be
used in games like Gartic.io, and we can simply draw and let computers to helped us bring out labels, doesn't that sounds great? 
That's why we want to give it a try.
