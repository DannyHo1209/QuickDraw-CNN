This is a project that uses CNN to determine what are the quick draw represent.
We used the dataset 'QuickDraw Sketches' for training and testing our model.

**Motivation :**  
You won't accept it if I say *'There is no exact motivates for doing this, we're doing this just because it looks fun :D'.*   
So, here is why : Since this is a dataset from the Google game 'Quick, Draw!', it's essential for most draw games. Imagine if this could be
used in games like Gartic.io, and we can simply draw and let computers to helped us bring out labels, doesn't that sounds great? 
That's why we want to give it a try.

**How can I execute it ?**   
There are multiple .py files in this project, and here are the list :
* main.py

* testing.py 
  - You can completely ignore this as it is just for us to test stuffs.
